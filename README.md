## Resources
This repository contains additional resources generated during the project.
They are stored inside the `resource` directory in the repository root. The
contents of the folders are as follows:

### resource/alg
A\* and Floodfill Algorithms

This is a standalone implementation of the pathfinding algorithm. You can compile
it with `make`. See the README.md inside this directory for more information

### resource/docs
Documentation Files

This folder contains general information about the project, such as a setup guide,
final report, poster, and anything else documentation wise.

### resource/gui
Past User Interface Files

This directory contains a prototype GUI written in Python. We no longer use it in
favor of a web-based UI, but we will keep it here for archival purposes.

### resource/pcb
Current, Past, and Future PCB Designs

These are the Eagle files used to manufacture the PCB of the robot.
